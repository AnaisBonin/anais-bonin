			<h1>About me</h1>
			<h2>Hi!</h2>
			<p>
				I am a French woman, in my early thirties, loving the outdoor which we
				can fully enjoy here in the Alps but also in so many places in France
				and in Europe.
			</p>
			<p>
				I am based near Grenoble, a beautiful city surrounded by Alpine
				mountains. Grenoble has some of the best engineers and incredible
				research institutes that are reknowned internationally (check our&nbsp;
				<a href="https://www.esrf.fr/ " className="word-emph" target="_blank">
					Synchrotron
				</a>
				, it is quite amazing).
			</p>
			<p>
				It is also very well connected ( Direct lines to Geneva or Lyon
				airports, 3h direct train to Paris, 1h20 to Lyon, 3h drive to
				Marseille... ), and only 30 min to go skiing :).
			</p>
			<h2> Professional life</h2>
			<p>
				I did many things in my twenties. Moved to Sweden and Canada, studied,
				worked, travelled...
			</p>
			<p>
				As a kid and a teen, I was much more of a scientist. My focus was on
				science, maths, physics, biology. But then I got curious about the world
				we live in and studied more of social, psychological and managerial
				sciences. I graduated with a{' '}
				<strong>Master's degree in Business Administration</strong> (MBA)
				specialized in <strong>Management</strong> (both team and project) and{' '}
				<strong>Communications.</strong>
			</p>
			<p>
				And obviously, as someone who loves puzzle and technologies, I became
				very into creating digital tools.
			</p>
			<p>
				After some years, I missed the technical parts of science, working with
				abstract concepts, algorithms, solving problems and intricate puzzles...
			</p>
			<p>
				That's why I decided to dedicate my whole time and the rest of my
				carrier to create, develop, code web applications. Went back to
				studying, started with <strong>Javascript React</strong>,{' '}
				<strong>Node.js</strong>, <strong>Typescript</strong>,{' '}
				<strong>SQL</strong>... (I already knew HTML and CSS from my studies and
				learning them on my freetime). And then I expended my knowledge with{' '}
				<strong>Java</strong> and so on.
			</p>
			<p>
				I will answer know a question everyone keep asking: "are you more into
				frontend or backend?" Honestly, I know you hate that but... both! I
				really like working with React and having fun with CSS. But, building
				servers and working with databases is also amazing. It is good to be
				able to switch sometime from one to the other :)
			</p>
			<p>
				Oh, one last thing. <span className="word-emph">Welcome!</span> :)
